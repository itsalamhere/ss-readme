for StudyStream users..
# Welcome! ✨🙌

There's a lot that I wanna tell you guys, but I just can't fit it out in the website. So I'm making one of my own, instead. :D

## Hello, everyone! 👋
I'm Alam. A fresh grad of Biomedical Engineering who's currently working on studies to reach his dreams. Been active on StudyStream since Sept'23 and has been gratefully finishing stuffs over the months 📆 Happy to be here studying together with ppl, striving their best to achieve what they dream to be. 

Personally, I'm on a space to figure out my boundaries and other things in life, Some ground rules of mine I like to apply in SS:

* `[📝]` I like to put my progress on the display. Trying my best to stick on what's written.

  * `[🍅]` I try my best to study here for at least 10 sessions -- Pomodoro 25+5 (although I usually compound the 5 mins tho for breaks)

* `[👊📺]` Usually at break I do give encouragements to people while watching YT -- Hacking time to do several stuffs at once, why not? This is my way of hanging on to the focus room, my thought went, "People are working through their own stuffs y'know, and they deserve some amount of support. That's all I can give, but hey it's more than nothing 🤗"

* `[💭]` As much as I want to study here, I also want to make good friends along the way. That being said, I could only work on it through chats for now.

  * `[💬]` I do like to reply in long chats; gathering thoughts on writing the chats as I speak. And hopefully getting to know each other deeper as we go.  But I will engage *👏as long 👏as you do 👏too*. 

  * `[❗]` **I'll be available to reply when I read the chat**. This way I don't forget it in case I got caught up on the studies. Keep in mind if you're feeling a bit concerned of this, okay? Worry not as I'm still gonna be in the room :)

I'll just leave these keywords out there in case you need something to talk about:

> `music` : `songwriting` `r&b` `orchestra` `jazz` `blues`
>          `breakcore` `pop` `jam-sessions` `hardcore` `omnigenre`
> `food` : `olive oil` `matcha` 
> `culture` : `learning languages`, 
> `games`: `pokemon` `osu!` 
> `others` : `healthcare`, `start-up`
> `people`: `andrew huberman` `tim ferriss` 
 
Last but not least.

Me doing all this effort, giving you all these is my decision. Whether you believe it or not, that's your choice. I can't control that, but hey I got a lot of things to reach. 

Soooo, yeah. Let's reach our dreams, shall we? Let's see each other on top.

# We're all in this together! 🙌🫂
