for StudyStream users..
# Welcome! ✨🙌

There's a lot that I wanna tell you guys, but I just can't fit it out in the website. So I'm making one of my own, instead. :D

## Hello, everyone! 👋
I'm Alam. A fresh grad of Biomedical Engineering, currently studying to reach his dreams. Been active on StudyStream since Sept'23 and has been gratefully finishing stuffs over the months 📆 Happy to be here studying together with ppl, striving their best to achieve what they dream to be. 

Personally, rn I'm on a space figuring out relationships with myself, few of which are where to spend my time and how I deal with things. One of ways I do that is putting ground rules, they are there to keep me sane, keep me going in life. Here are some of mine I like to apply in SS:

* `[📝]` I like to put my to-do list and progress on the display, will update the small progress when a session has passed.

  * `[🍅]` I try my best to study here for at least 10 sessions -- Pomodoro 25+5 (although I usually compound the 5 mins tho for breaks)
 
    * `[📌]` I honestly wouldn't mind to be pinned on these sessions, as long as it helps you to study. **BUT** plleeease do encourage before pinning. I may have freaked out inside not knowing who does therefore I'll refresh. Thanks for your awareness 🙏

* `[👊📺]` After those sessions usually I do give encouragements to people while watching YT, having some break -- Time's limited, and hacking time to do several stuffs at once won't hurt, so why not? 

  * `[👟]` At times this is my way to hang on to the study; reminding myself you're not alone at doing your studies. Also my thought went, "People are working through their own stuffs y'know, we don't know how they've been through, so they deserve some amount of support." (P.S. I like to be ✨*sonder*✨ to people, trying to be helpful with the best I have atm) Encouragement's all I can give tho, but hey it's more than nothing 🤗

* `[💭]` As much as I want to study here, I also want to make good friends along the way. That being said, given the circumstances, I could only work on it through chats for now. Usually will reply after the encouragements, 

  * `[💬]` I do like to reply in long chats; gathering thoughts on writing the chats as I speak, while trying to keep the conversation going. And hopefully getting to know each other deeper as we go. But I will engage *as long as you do too*. Have some questions in exchange, at least if you have no clue, that'd be fine.

  * `[❗]` **I'll be available to reply when I read the chat**. This way I don't forget it in case I got caught up on the studies--I've been on the receiving end and I know how it feels, so I'm letting you know beforehand. Hold your horses if you're feeling a bit concerned of this, okay? I may get caught up into the studies for up to weeks, but I'll try my best to send the messages back to you 📨

* `[📍]` I'll just leave these keywords out there in case you need something to talk about:

| `Interests` | `*"Any specifics?"*`                                   |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `music!` | `songwriting` `r&b` `orchestra` `jazz` `blues` `singing!`  |
|         | `breakcore` `pop` `jam-sessions` `hardcore` `omni-genre` `...`  |
| `food`  | `olive oil!` `matcha!` `spices!` `foods-from-other-countries` | 
| `learning-languages` | `italiano` `3arabiya` `(learning these atm)` |
| `games` | `pokemon (ROM-hacks)` `osu!` |
| `science-topics (?)` | `MedTech` `BioTech` `HealthTech` `NanoTech` `Nutritional Science!` |
| `others` | `start-up!` `working-out!` `cultures from other countries` `programming (never thought I'd like it now)` `travel (working on it)` |
| `people i look up to` | `Andrew Huberman` `Tim Ferriss` |
 
Last but not least.

My first thought of making this website is that I wanna create genuine connections, either based on interest, passions, or other things we have in common. I got quite things to share, would it be interests up to disclaimers, I put some here (there's a lot of stories in one human, one might say), that way I don't need to remind it to ppl another times.

Doing all this effort, giving you all these is my decision. If you're fine with all above, let's go have some chat in SS :D But at last I can't deny the fact that people may be busy with their agendas, studies and lives, ey that's fine. I can't control that either way, we can mind each other's business on the focus room. At last we're here to focus and study, right? Thanks for reading this far :D

Soooo, yeah. Let's reach our dreams, shall we? Let's see each other on top.

## We're all in this together! 🙌🫂
