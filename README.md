for StudyStream users..
# Welcome! ✨🙌

There's a lot that I wanna tell you guys, but I just can't fit it out in the website. So I'm making one of my own, instead. :D

## Hello, everyone! 👋
I'm Alam. A biomedical engineering grad who's currently working on studies a bunch of stuffs to reach list of his dreams. Been active on StudyStream since Sept'23 and has been gratefully finishing stuffs over the months 📆 Happy to be here studying together with ppl, striving their best to achieve what they dream to be. I do have a good bunch of interests, and some options are not there in SS. So here are several more keywords:

> `music`: `songwriting` `orchestra` `jazz` `blues` `pop` `jam sessions` `hardcore` `omnigenre`, `food`, `culture`: `learning languages`, `healthcare`, `start-up` `others`: `pokemon` 

Some ground rules of mine in SS:

* `[📝]` I like to put my progress on the display. Trying my best to stick on what's written.

  * `[🍅]` I like to study here for at least 10 sessions -- Pomodoro 25+5 (although I usually compound the 5 tho for breaks XD)

* `[👊📺]` Usually at break I do give encouragements to people while watching YT -- Hacking time to do several stuffs at once, why not? This is my way of hanging on to the focus room: "People are working through their own stuffs y'know, and they deserve some amount of support. That's all I can give, but hey it's more than nothing 🤗"

* `[💭]` As much as I want to study here, I also want to make good friends along the way. That being said, I could only work on it through chats for now. Several things you need to know:

  * `[💬]` I do like to reply in long chats; gathering thoughts on writing the chats as I speak. And hopefully getting to know each other deeper as we go.  But I will engage *as long as you do too*. 

  * `[❗]` **I'll be available to reply when I read the chat**. This way I don't forget it in case I got caught up on the studies. Keep in mind if you're feeling a bit concerned of this, okay? Worry not as I'm still gonna be in the room :)

...
 
Last but not least.

Me doing all this effort, giving you all these is my decision. Whether you believe it or not is your choice. I can't control that, but hey I got a lot of  things to reach. 

So, yeah. Let's reach our dreams, shall we? Let's see each other on top.

# We're all in this together! 🙌🫂
