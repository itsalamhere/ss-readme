# *Welcome!* ✨🙌

There's a lot that I wanna tell ya, but I just can't fit it out in the SS bio. So I'm making a tiiiiny bit of website instead. :D

### *Hello, everyone!* 👋
I'm Alam. A fresh grad of Biomedical Engineering, currently studying while exploring stuffs and reaching his dreams. Been active on StudyStream since `Sept'23` and has been gratefully finishing stuffs over the months 📆 Happy to be here studying together with ppl, striving their best to achieve what they dream to be.

## *Before you proceed..*

Personally, rn I'm on a space of figuring out relationships with myself more. Few of which are where to spend my time and how I deal with things. One of ways I do that is putting up some ground rules--they are there to keep me sane and to keep me going in life. Here are some of mine I like to apply in SS, summed up in emojis at display:

* `[📝]` I like to put my to-do list and progresses on the display, will update the small progresses when a session has passed.

  * `[🍅]` I try my best to study here for at least 10 sessions -- Pomodoro 25+5 (although I usually compound the 5 mins tho for breaks)
 
    * `[📌]` I honestly wouldn't mind to be pinned on these sessions, as long as it helps you to study. **BUT** plleeease do encourage before pinning. I may have freaked out inside not knowing who does. Thanks for your awareness 🙏

* `[👊📺]` After those sessions usually I do give encouragements to people while watching YT, having some break -- Time's limited, and hacking time to do several stuffs at once won't hurt, so why not? 

  * `[👟]` At times this is my way to hang on to the study, by reminding myself you're not alone at doing your studies. At last that's what we're here for, to study and reach our goals together.
    
  * Also my thought went, "People are working through their own stuffs y'know.. We don't know how they've been through, so they deserve some amount of support." (P.S. I like to be ✨*sonder*✨ to people, trying to be helpful with the best that I have atm) Encouragement's all I can work with, but hey it's more than nothing 🤗

* `[💭]` As much as I want to study here, I also want to make good friends along the way. That being said, given the circumstances, I could only work on it through chats for now. **Will engage when 💭 is on display.** 

  * `[💬]` I do like to reply in long chats; gathering thoughts on writing the chats as I speak, weaving in curiosities about one another, while trying to keep the conversation going. And hopefully getting to know each other deeper as we go. But I will engage *as long as you do too*. Have some questions in exchange at least if you got no clue, that'd be fine for me.

  * `[❗]` **I'll be available to reply when I read the chat**. This way I don't forget it in case I got caught up on the studies--I've been on the receiving end and I know how it feels, so I'm letting you know beforehand. Hold your horses if you're feeling a bit concerned of this, okay? I may get caught up into the studies for up to weeks, but I'll try my best to send the messages back to you 📨
 
  * `[👥]` **I'm more comfortable to follow people that we've chatted well with.** We could have a same interest, or passion, getting curious with each other, or just simple values and likings in general. OR some people that don't accept messages due to privacy settings but I find them interesting, I could try my shot, maybe things could go well, who knows?

  * `[👥]` ***21/03:*** These weeks I've seen a category of people who may be really busy with their studies but still wanna vibe well (study together) on the focus room. So I decided to follow these people too. Maybe we can support each other through the feeds--it may not be much, but hey it's a good start. If you see this, thanks for getting along on the journey, and let's reach our own goals together, shall we? ^^

* `[📍]` As in interest, I feel like most of them are pretty niche (I like to explore and experiment with stuffs, i guess), These are some that I could think of for now:

## Interests

| `Interests` | *`"Any specifics?"`*                                   |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `music!` | `songwriting!` `r&b!` `orchestra` `jazz!` `blues` `singing!`  |
|         | `breakcore` `pop` `jam-sessions` `hardcore` `omni-genre` `funk!`  |
| `food`  | `olive-oil!` `matcha!` `spices!` `foods-from-other-countries` | 
| `learning-languages` | `deutsch` `italiano` `3arabiya` `(learning these atm)` |
| `games` | `pokemon (ROM-hacks)` `osu!` |
| `science-and-tech` | `MedTech` `BioTech` `HealthTech` `NanoTech` `Nutritional-Science!` |
| `others` | `start-up!` `working-out!` `cultures-from-other-countries` `programming` `travel` |

## *Last but not least...*

One thought of making this is that I wanna create genuine connections, either based on interest, passions, or other things we have in common. With the atmosphere that we have on SS, where one is occupied with their studies or goals, I try my best to find one way through it. 

There's a lot of stories in one person yk, and I feel like I got quite things to share, but leaving them on head would just make it unseen, so I make this. Would it be interests up to disclaimers, hey at least you know that person's a little bit better. 

If you reach this far, thank you for sparing your time 🙏 If you're interested to know more or have any question, feel free to get into the chat. If you don't, that's fine too, at last we're here to focus and study, right? 📝📈

Soooooo, yeah. That's it. Let's reach our own stars, shall we? Sky's the limit. Let's see each other on top!
